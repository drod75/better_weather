Better Weather is a weather app that uses the Flask framework and Open-Meteo API to provide weather information for any city,
county, state, or region that you can think of!

The app has been designed to incorporate AI and provide users with a suggestion for the day based on the weather information,
in order to do this we use the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Llama 3 model.

The development of Better Weather was done by David Rodriguez, Christopher Bonafacio, and Emma Katz, our story is that
after competing in the Queens College Hackathon, we decided to create a better weather app that would out class
the one we had created. We also decided to use the Open-Meteo API to get weather information for any city because our
old weather app was using the OpenWeatherMap API which was not very effective for our use case. We also decided to use
Llama 3 because it is one of the best models and available for free via the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Overall we are very proud of the work we have done and we hope you enjoy using Better Weather!
